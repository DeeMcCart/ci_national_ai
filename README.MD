 <h2>TESTING</h2>

 I have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well, as outlined in the various types of testing below: Manual testing, Lighthouse testing using developer tools, viewing the website on different browsers both manually and online and validator testing using online validation websites W3C and Jigsaw. 
 
  Also, as noted in the features section above, I have also manually tested all of the project's features and ensured that they operated as intended, outlining the response in each of the features sections.

 I tested the website in a variety of ways to ensure full functionality. This included manual testing (e.g. testing each feature and ensuring that it could complete what it was in place to complete) Additionally, I interacted with developer tools and the lighthouse function to see the code/make updates and to test different viewports. I manually checked the viewports on my phone and laptop also to ensure that the website was fully responsive, as intended. I also tested the website on different viewports online.

   I used different tools to perform the validation testing on the code, as outlined below. I used W3C to test HTML and W3C Jigsaw to test CSS.

 <h3>Manual Testing of the responsiveness of the website:</h3>
 1. To different viewports
  Once I deployed my website, I opened the link on my i-phone and noted 
    I applied flex to these elements and retested per below:

<h2>User Experience:</h2>

<b>Brainstorm:& Research</b>

<p>I brainstormed this idea by thinking about what type of website would be ideal for the goal that I have in mind: A minimum viable product that is well done and doesn't negate from the website due to lack of Javascript etc. 

I brainstormed the shape of the website by using Balsamiq/Lucidcharts to develop a wireframe, which was made readily available to students of the Code institute. Please see screengrabs of my Balsamiq/Lucidcharts design below:

![alt text]()

Data centres...relevance...impact on society..ethics

I believe that the site is very user friendly, it is responsive and interactive, clearly laid out and accessible as it contains alts and aria-labels for screen readers.

I considered the five planes of user experience (as outlined in the Code Institute webinars) when designing my website:
 Strategy Plane, Scope Plane, Structure Plane, Skeleton Plane and the Surface Plane.

Please see how I considered these below:

1. Strategy Plane: 

When deciding on what features to include, I compared viability and feasibility (whether I had the skills, resources and time to implement the desired features) to Importance (business goals and user needs). Deciding on what to keep and not to keep.

The business goals with the website included:

  -Create online presence-interlinking all platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube)
  -Make resource available
  -Link in with various data sources
  -Offer caveats that mortgage may not be offered and prices may changes
  -Link several data sources
  -AI: Gemini and ChatGPT
  -Stacked agents

2. Scope Plane:

When considering the scope plane, I focussed on what to include to satisfy all of the user needs.
As mentioned in the tutorials, I applied an agile approach to building my website-logging in often and making small bitesize increments of development on each occassion as opposed to rushing things or being wreckless.
The wireframe and mentor meetings assisted to create focus and to develop realistic expectations. 
I decided on the features and everything felt more manageable and controllable.

 When being realistic, I also considered new ideas for future features-as outlined elsewhere in this README.

 Per the tutorials, the time a developer has to commit to building something is rarely over one month-described as a 'sprint'. Considering this, if the scope is too big and too ambitious, I knew I would not meet deadlines or the project deadline date and considered this when planning.

 Having watched the tutorials, I know to avoid scope creep (adding random new features too late) as this could be wreckless. Though, saying that, I did add a couple of features when refining the website in the last week when doing w3c testing (e.g. I added animations)
 I didn't want the scope to be too small as this would lead to unimpressive products.

 Per the tutorials, the user's requirements can be split into three subcategories:

 -What users need
 -What they actually need
 -What they don't know they need

 In terms of content requirements, mixed content was used in our website-with images, video and animations and I deemed that everything incldued was useful, sellable and buildable.

 I also considered the below four questions in relation to business rules:
 Objective-Functional-Non-functional-Business rules

 Objective-what does user want to accomplish?
 Functional-What does user need to do to accomplish objective?
 Non-functional-What contraints does the website have?
 Scaleable: As the user base grows, can the application handle the growth in traffic?

 The product is a virtual representation of  a service.

 User story-how user interacts with system

 <b>User Stories planned for site:</b>

 Take user stories off share file


3. Structure Plane:

the structure plane is concerned with the organisation of functionality and content. Navigating through in a functional way.

I ensured the different categories of information are divided into sections, articles, divisions and paragraphs, as appropriate. The information is presented in an organised and intuitive way.

<b>Interaction Design</b>

The interaction design is the structure and behavior of the interactive systems within the website (e.g. )

I ensured the following when designing the website:
<ul>
<li>Site is consistent, predictable , learnable, visible and clear feedback (navigation bar and social links on every page)</li>
<li>Interactive features are consistent in colouring, the combination of purple and white is used throughout the website as I believe the simply but stark layout suits the theme. Also, the submit buttons on the 'Sign-Up Form' are all coloured in aqua-marine to stand out as slightly different form the rest of the website but consistent with each other. 
</li>
<li>Scenario: Icons, navigation tabs and social links operate consistently on each of the three pages</li>
<li>Consistency of terms, content and imagery have a stable and consistent style. The font used throughout is Verdana and I aimed to keep the tone consistent</li>
</ul>

I ensured that items only differed from the expected design when the website was enhanced because of it

A few examples of these design enhancements include 

4. Skeleton Plane:

<p>The skeleton plane is concerned with the navigation design and interface design.
The two main things to consider, are what form the application will take in terms of design and how users will get around what is presented.

The goals are:
Give form to function
Establish value in the users mind
Leads user toward continuing experience as they will be inspired to revisit the website
Value is added with each click-taking user feedback, providing information and creating links with other social emdia platforms
Add positivity to overall experience with each interaction

The website is essentially a suite of visual conventions and I am aiming to give users what they want when they want it.

Progressive disclosure-reveal information across space...navigation-different tabs used

Visually group information in order of importance- 

I considered the Hick-Hyman Law, that if the user is presented with too many options, it will take them longer to reach a decision so I tried to keep the message clear and uniform 

I inserted representational icons using icons from fontawesome.

I ensured consistency across the tabs. 

Good information design should be invisible, only bas design is noticeable.

I tried to make the website easy to navigate, with relevant, different information on each making for good information design. Per the tutorials, too much information is worse then no information so I tried to keep all of the informaiton conveyed as concise as possible. The context and order matter and there is a hierarchy of importance.

The website is categorical when the information is similar, divided into sections, articles and paragraphs accordingly and colour coorindated 

Per the tutorial instruction, I tried to ensure that the overall website was clean, minimal and effective

<h4>Wireframes</h4>

Wireframes are often used in website design and are relevant to the skeleton plane.. These are 2D models of what finished product will be which should be completed at the research phase. As referenced earlier, I used Balsamiq to create my wireframe, a simplified, stripped down version of what I wanted my website to be.

It worked as a starting point and helped me to decide on the form, information architecture and arrangement.

It allowed us to see the overall balance of elements and structure and to decide on what gets included and how it's organised. The wireframes help the develop to revisit the strategy and goals of the website and to investigate whether the relationships work and does it make sense (labels, arrangement and navigation)

5. Surface Plane:

The surface plane is a visual language that provides information and context. It provides colour, layout, fonts, images, order, sequence and the site's identity.

It is also concerned with economy- important elements should be easily recognised. I applied this with italics and boldings as well as heading size and the structure of the sections.

I considered progressive disclosure, and as the user moves through navigational elements, e.g.

I also considered color contrast between foreground and background. I used the colour combination of purple on white throughout as it was simple but stark and offered adequate contrast so as to ensure that all of the text was legible  and consistent.

I used the font of Verdana as I researched fond online and it was recommended as highly legible no matter what font size.
