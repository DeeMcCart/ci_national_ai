## *Introduction*

### **-What the project hopes to accomplish.**

The project aims to identify a problem affecting modern society and to provide an AI-driven solution through a website designed to address that problem. Evidencing that AI is here for good.

**Problem Identification**  
The pain point we have identified is the lack of easily accessible, comprehensive information and assistance available online for people looking to securely purchase a home. The solutions are often buried deep within dense documents, hidden in hyperlinks in small print on webpage footers. Moreover, the information is scattered across unconnected websites, creating a tedious obstacle course for users.

**Proposed Solution**  
Our solution, ‘Homie,’ consolidates all relevant information in a fun and engaging way through an accessible chatbot interface. We address this problem by developing a web application featuring an interactive form and chatbot. Using Chat GPT-4.0, integrated with Gemini, we responsibly sourced extensive datasets to empower the AI with the ability to offer informed and personalized advice. This service draws on a variety of data sources to consider the user’s financial situation and suggests multiple paths to homeownership or rental, including the identification of potential grants and financial assistance programs.

**Implementation**

Given the time constraints and the varying experience levels within our team, we assigned a Scrum Master and adhered to the Agile methodology. We utilized a Kanban board for task management, shared Excel files and Google Drive for collaboration, and Slack for communication. Daily stand-ups were held to ensure alignment, and tasks were carefully divided and assigned based on skillsets.

From the outset, we focused on ensuring the effectiveness, innovation, and practical utility of our solution. We incorporated diverse datasets to enhance accuracy and reduce the risk of AI hallucinations, ensuring that our chatbot delivers clear and reliable advice. Functionality was prioritized, with the application designed to be fully operational for a live demo.

Creativity and originality were central to our approach, and we implemented a rigorous technical process. By setting up a host coding page, establishing a review mechanism, and using wireframes and system architecture diagrams, we ensured that our project was technically sound and well-coordinated.

## **Process for Setting Up a Collaborative Environment on GitHub (Step-by-Step Process)**

### 1. **Setting Up the Repository**

- **Create the Repository:**
  - One team member created a new repository on GitHub. This repository will serve as the central hub for all project files and version control.
  - Named our repository appropriately (e.g., `ci_national_ai`) and initialized it with a `README.md` file.
  - Set our repository to "Public" but could be "Private" based on your team's needs.

- **Clone the Repository:**
  - Each team member cloned the repository to their local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<username>/<repository-name>.git
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
  - This created a local copy of the repository on each member’s machine.

### 2. **Main Branch Management**

- **Main Branch as the Production Branch:**
  - The `main` branch should be considered the production-ready branch. This means that any code merged into `main` should be thoroughly tested and fully functional.
  - Protect the `main` branch by setting up branch protection rules in the GitHub settings. This can include requiring pull request reviews and passing status checks before any code can be merged.

### 3. **Branching Strategy**

- **Create a Branch for Each Feature or Fix:**
  - Team members created a new branch for each feature, bug fix, or task worked on. This isolates changes and prevents conflicts with the main branch.
  - Naming convention for branches could be `feature/description`, `fix/description`, or `hotfix/description`. 
  For example:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/chatbot-integration
    ```
  - This command creates a new branch and switches to it.

- **Importance of Creating Fresh Branches:**
  - Always create a fresh branch from `main` before starting new work. This ensures that your new branch includes the latest updates from the `main` branch.
  - After completing work on a branch, push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request for review.

### 4. **Push and Pull Requests**

- **Committing Changes:**
  - Regularly commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages. This helps maintain a clear history of what changes were made and why.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added chatbot integration to the landing page"
    ```

- **Pushing Changes to GitHub:**
  - Push your branch to the GitHub repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

- **Creating a Pull Request (PR):**
  - Once your feature or fix is complete, open a pull request from your branch to `main` on GitHub. This allows other team members to review your changes before they are merged.
  - Ensure that your PR includes:
    - A clear title and description of what the PR addresses.
    - Any relevant issue numbers or references.
    - Screenshots or testing results if applicable.

- **Review and Merge:**
  - Other team members should review the pull request, leave comments, and request changes if necessary.
  - Once approved, the branch can be merged into `main`. It's important to delete the branch after merging to keep the repository clean.

### Data Considerations for Model Fine-Tuning with Vertex AI

When determining the data to gather for fine-tuning our model using Vertex AI, we evaluated several fine-tuning methods:

**Supervised Fine-Tuning:**  
This approach involves using a dataset where each example includes both an input (such as text or an image) and a corresponding desired output (such as a classification label or a generated text response). Supervised fine-tuning is particularly suited for tasks such as classification, summarization, reasoning, and question-answering.

**Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):**  
This method involves fine-tuning the model based on human feedback to adjust the tone and style of the model's responses. An example of this process is when models like ChatGPT present multiple responses and ask users to rate them. While this technique can be valuable for refining the model's output style, we have determined that it is not necessary for our current objectives.

**Model Distillation:**  
Model distillation is typically employed to transfer the knowledge from a larger model to a smaller one, creating a more lightweight version suitable for deployment on devices with limited resources, such as Android. However, this method is not relevant to our current needs and will not be utilized.

### Data Considerations for Supervised Learning

Given that our training will focus on supervised learning tasks, it was crucial to carefully curate the dataset. The data had to be structured effectively, particularly in a question-and-answer format, to ensure that the model performed optimally in the targeted applications.

We recognized the need for data that could be formatted in a conversational question/answer format to facilitate supervised fine-tuning.

### User Experience

We incorporated the five planes of user experience in the design of HomeIE:

1. **Strategy Plane:** Defined the objectives of the website, focusing on providing accessible housing advice.
2. **Scope Plane:** Determined the functionalities required to meet user needs, such as the chatbot and API integrations.
3. **Structure Plane:** Organized the content and features in a logical and user-friendly manner.
4. **Skeleton Plane:** Developed wireframes and mockups to visualize the layout and navigation.
5. **Surface Plane:** Applied visual design principles to ensure the website is aesthetically pleasing and consistent.

### Collaboration Tools

Throughout the project, we used various collaboration tools to streamline development:

- **GitHub:** Managed version control, pull requests, and code reviews.
- **Slack:** Facilitated communication and coordination among team members.
- **Virtual Machines and APIs:** Used for testing and integration with external data sources. Below are screengrabs of these processes:

### 1. Strategy Plane

When deciding on what features to include, we compared viability and feasibility (whether the team had the skills, resources, and time to implement the desired features) against importance (alignment with business goals and user needs). The core element of this plane is making strategic decisions about what features and elements to include or exclude, ensuring that the project remains focused and achievable.

The business goals for the website are categorized as follows:

**Internal Objectives:**

- Create an online presence by leveraging resources such as RTB, Daft.ie, MyHome.ie, and CSO.
- Link in with various data sources to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
- Link several data sources to ensure data consistency and reliability.
- Incorporate AI technologies like Gemini and ChatGPT to demonstrate that AI is a beneficial tool.
- Utilize stacked agents to optimize system performance and capability.

**User-Centric Goals:**

- Make resources available to potential home buyers, providing them with valuable information and tools.
- Offer caveats that mortgages may not be offered, and prices may change, ensuring transparency and managing user expectations.

### 2. Scope Plane:

When considering the scope plane, we focused on what to include to satisfy all of the user needs. We applied an agile approach to building HomeIE—with a Kanban board, user stories, assigned tasks, daily stand-ups, and sprints. The wireframes and stand-ups helped create focus and develop realistic expectations. We decided on the features through extensive huddles on Slack, which provided clarity, with the tasks seeming manageable and controllable.

As per the Hackathon Guidance, we believe that the project is very scalable and thus have included details on future features that could be developed upon.

We adjusted the sprints, etc., to suit the compressed timeline of the Hackathon.

Due to time pressure, there was a danger of scope creep (adding random new features too late), so we actively avoided this by employing the MOSCOW prioritization technique; considering what items were **must have**, **should have**, and **could have**.

![Kanban Board- MOSCOW](./assets/kanban.png)

When distinguishing what features to add, we considered:

- What users need.
- What they actually need.
- What they don't know they need.

In terms of content requirements, we included mixed content with images, logos, *video*, and *animations*, ensuring that everything included was useful, sellable, and buildable.

*Adjust to content of the end product, will we have a form, will we have video/animations/live data.*

We also evaluated the project from a commercial perspective, focusing on four key aspects of business rules:

1. **Objective**: What does the user want to accomplish? The user wants to find tailored advice on how to secure a home (based on their personal situation). They want to consider all angles. The platform meets this objective by leveraging data and AI to provide personalized, relevant insights, making the advice more actionable and precise.
2. **Functional**: What does the user need to do to achieve that objective? The user needs to fill out a form with key details. This will be linked with the interactive AI Chatbot, which will offer tailored prompts based on the queries that the user sends to it. The user experience is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that users can easily navigate the process to receive the advice they need.
3. **Non-functional**: What constraints does the website have? It is currently working with static data, and GPU limitations and the tight timeframe limited the size of the datasets we could train the model with. In the future, we plan to explore dynamic data integration and potential infrastructure upgrades to overcome these current limitations and enhance the system’s capabilities.
4. **Scalability**: As the user base grows, can the application handle increased traffic? Yes, no PPI is stored for each user. Additionally, the application’s backend is designed to scale with the user base, utilizing cloud services and modular architecture to handle increased traffic efficiently. This ensures that as the platform grows, it can maintain performance and reliability.

**User Stories Planned for HomeIE:**

As a team, we brainstormed some user stories when thinking about how to build the project.

We created a shared Excel file and input user stories for consideration under the following headings:

![Alt text](./assets/user_stories.png)

Sample of user stories:
<table>
    <caption><b>User Stories Planned for HomeIE</b></caption>
    <tr>
        <th><b>User Story</b></th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>As a first-time homebuyer, I want advice on mortgage options available to me based on my income and savings.</td>
        <td>Text response with a list of mortgage options</td>
        <td>"You are eligible for the Help to Buy scheme and a first-time buyer mortgage with X Bank."</td>
        <td>RTB, Daft.ie, CSO mortgage datasets</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>As a user, I want to find properties in my price range in Dublin.</td>
        <td>List of properties with brief details (price, location)</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
        <td>Daft.ie, MyHome.ie property listings</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>As a potential buyer, I want to know the average property prices in my desired area over the past year.</td>
        <td>Text or graph showing price trends</td>
        <td>"The average property price in Dublin 8 was €350,000 over the past year."</td>
        <td>CSO, Property Price Register (PPR)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>As a renter, I want to understand the potential rental yield of a property based on current market trends.</td>
        <td>Percentage or text-based explanation</td>
        <td>"The estimated rental yield for this property is 5%."</td>
        <td>Daft.ie, MyHome.ie rental listings and trends</td>
    </tr>
</table>

 ### 3. Structure Plane:

The structure plane is concerned with the organization of functionality and content, ensuring that users can navigate the website effectively and intuitively.

**Information Presentation**

The information on "HomeIE" is presented in a structured and intuitive manner, with a clear hierarchy that guides users through the site. Content is organized logically, prioritizing the most relevant information for potential homebuyers. For example, property search results are prominently displayed, and key resources are accessible from the main navigation.

**Interaction Design**

The interaction design of "HomeIE" focuses on creating a seamless and engaging experience for users as they interact with the website’s features, such as forms and the AI-powered chatbot. These interactive elements are designed to be consistent, predictable, and user-friendly.

We ensured the following when designing the website:

- **Consistency and Clarity**: The site’s design maintains a consistent and predictable layout throughout, with clear labeling and instructions for all interactive elements. This ensures that users can easily understand how to use the site.
- **Color and Font Choices**: The interactive features, including forms and buttons, use a consistent color scheme of [Color 1] and [Color 2], which were selected based on their popularity in modern home designs and their ability to provide clear visual cues. The font used across the site is [Font Name], chosen for its readability and modern aesthetic, helping to maintain a professional and welcoming tone.
- **Scenario-Based Design**: The design elements, including terminology, content, and imagery, are consistent across the site, providing a stable and familiar experience. We considered various user scenarios to ensure that the website meets the needs of all users, from first-time homebuyers to experienced investors.

These design choices were made to ensure that the overall user experience is not only functional but also enjoyable, encouraging users to return to the site as a trusted resource in their home-buying journey.

### 4. Skeleton Plane:

The skeleton plane is concerned with the navigation and interface design of the website. The primary considerations are the form that the application will take and how users will navigate through the presented content.

**Key Goals:**
- **Give form to function**: Ensure that every design element serves a clear purpose and supports the website’s overall functionality.
- **Establish value in the user’s mind**: Create a user experience that adds value with each interaction, encouraging users to return to the site.
- **Encourage continued engagement**: By making information useful and relevant, we aim to inspire users to revisit the website, recommend it to others, or return when their circumstances change. (Noting that we protect user privacy by not storing personal information/PPI).

- **Enhance user experience**: Each interaction is designed to add positivity, whether through providing valuable information, taking user feedback into account, or creating seamless links to other platforms (Daft.ie, MABS, Home.ie).

**Progressive Disclosure**: We reveal information gradually, allowing users to explore content without being overwhelmed. For example, after users fill out the initial form, they gain access to more tailored advice from the chatbot.

**Navigation Design**: The website features a simple and intuitive navigation structure with clearly labeled tabs that guide users through the process of securing a home. For instance, users start with a form that gathers essential details, which the chatbot then uses to provide personalized advice.

In designing the website, we grouped information visually based on its importance. The form must be completed before interacting with the chatbot, ensuring that the chatbot’s responses are accurate and relevant.

We considered the **Hick-Hyman Law**, which suggests that offering too many options can slow decision-making. Therefore, we kept the design clear and uniform, minimizing the number of choices presented at any given time.

Good information design is often invisible—users should feel that the site is easy to navigate without noticing the effort that went into its design. We aimed to achieve this by making the website clean, minimal, and effective, ensuring that users can find what they need quickly and easily.

**Use of Wireframes in Relation to the Skeleton Plane:**

Wireframes were essential in planning the layout and structure of the website. Created during the research phase using Balsamiq, these 2D models provided a simplified, stripped-down version of the website. They served as a starting point, helping us decide on the form, information architecture, and arrangement of elements.

Wireframes allowed us to balance the overall design, ensure the functionality of each element, and verify that the relationships between different parts of the website made sense. They were crucial in developing the strategy and goals for the website, enabling us to refine the design based on feedback and testing.

### 5. Surface Plane

The surface plane is a visual language that provides information and context. It encompasses color, layout, fonts, images, order, sequence, and the overall identity of the site.

This plane is also concerned with **economy**—ensuring that important elements are easily recognized by users. We applied this principle by using italics and bolding to highlight key information, along with carefully selected heading sizes and structured sections to guide the user's attention.

We considered **progressive disclosure**, gradually revealing more detailed information as users move through the website. For example, initial property search results provide basic details, with more in-depth information available upon further interaction.

Color contrast was a key consideration. We used a **purple on white** color scheme throughout the website as it provides a simple yet stark contrast, ensuring that all text is legible and consistent across different devices and lighting conditions.

We selected the **Roboto** font after researching its legibility across various screen sizes and resolutions. This font was chosen for its clean, modern look, which aligns with HomeIE's brand identity and enhances readability, whether the text is small or large.

**Visual Identity and Consistency**

The visual elements of HomeIE—color, font, and layout—work together to create a cohesive identity that reflects the website's purpose and values. The color scheme is both modern and approachable, aligning with our goal of making the home-buying process as straightforward as possible. The consistent use of design elements, such as spacing and typography, ensures a seamless experience as users navigate through the site.

In summary, the surface plane of HomeIE is designed to be clean, minimal, and effective, providing users with a visually pleasing and intuitive experience that supports their journey toward securing a home.
